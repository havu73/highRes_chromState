MissingOutputException in line 28 of /gstore/home/vuh6/source/chromHMM_training/train_big_model/compare_big_small_models.snakefile:
Job completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds:
../../../model_analysis/K562_hg19/compare_models/confusionM_stateOverlap.txt
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.

Removing output files of failed job calculate_state_overlap_two_models since they might be corrupted:

Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
