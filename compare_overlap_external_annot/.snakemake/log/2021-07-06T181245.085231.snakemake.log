Removing output files of failed job overlap_with_genome_contexts since they might be corrupted:
../../model_analysis/K562_hg19/all_mark_model/state_8/full_model/overlap_crispr_mpra/train_overlap.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
